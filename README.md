# High-Accuracy-Vehicle-Dynamic-Model
This repository provides a high-accuracy vehicle dynamic model based on a vehicle body model (longitudinal, lateral, and yaw dynamics) and a high-fidelity tire model, validated to produce results nearly identical to Carsim under the same specifications.  It supports both conventional vehicle control and advanced drift control applications.
